# WebRTC-Powered-Voice-chat

Coded in a weekend using NodeJS server and peerJS to leverage WebRTC features to have a low latency voice call web app. Since WebRTC uses UDP, the latency is quite low. However, in weak network areas the latency is still high.

# Future work in progress

Voice stream compression to minimize the latency. Different techniques can be employed however, the current one requires voice-stream to be in browser supported format.
